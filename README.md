repository for McDaniel's Data Mining course week 3 assignment
I'm looking forward what this course has in store for me. 
I have always heard data cleaning and data mining are a crucial part of data science and I look forward on working on a project for that.
Also I'm excited to learn R, which is the language we are working on in this course.
